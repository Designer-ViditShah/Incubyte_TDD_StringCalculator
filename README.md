# Incubyte_TDD_StringCalculator

The Tester file and the Calculator file is inside src/main/java/main/java/

For TDD:
There are three steps:
  Fail
  Run
  Refactor
  
also known as Red Green Blue cycle


Starting with the basic test case we try to fail our test case first

Finding the error we try to fix it in the simplest form and make the code run

Once the code pass the test case, if refactoring is required it is done

After refactoring if the test fails than repeat the cycle else move to the next testcase
